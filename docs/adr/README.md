# Architectural Decision Records

We capture architecture-impacting decisions in lightweight ADRs. When making a change that affects system structure, dependencies, security posture, or operational practices:

1. Copy `docs/adr/template.md` to a new file named `NNNN-title.md` (zero-padded index).
2. Update the status, context, and consequences with relevant details.
3. Reference the ADR in pull requests and update when decisions are superseded.

Keep ADRs small, focused, and action-oriented so the family team can understand why choices were made.
